# ARTH-team-task-1
Whatsup everyone. Hope you all are safe and sound. This is the repo which contains the combined efforts of me and my team members in creating a Menu-Driven Python program for automating some of the most demanding and used technologies around the world. This is a step-wise guide to help you understand the working and execution of our program

# Team members who contributed in this project :-
1. Prayag Magotra (B.Tech 3rd Year student, Pune)
2. Mahima Jindal (B.Tech 3rd Year student, Uttrakhand)
3. Pawar Suvarna (B.Tech 3rd Year student, Pune)
4. Jitender Mahara (B.Tech 2nd Year student, Uttrakhand)

# Contribution of Every team member :-
1. Mahima Jindal - Amazon Web Services (AWS) integration with Python
2. Pawar Suvarna - Hadoop and LVM integration with Python
3. Prayag Magotra - Docker Engine integrated with Python
4. Jitender Mahara - Basic Linux Operations integrated with Python

# Step-wise guide to execution of the program :-
1. Make sure to login into your RHEL8 system as "ROOT" user
2. If you have 'git' installed in your system, that's fine. But in case, 'git' is not installed in your system, just use this command :-
    
*"yum install git -y"*     or     *"dnf install git -y"*

3. Create one directory in your root directory using the command :-

*mkdir /root/clone*

4. Go inside the created directory using the command :-

*cd /root/clone*

5. Once landed inside, we first have to initialize the directory with git so that the cloning becomes easy. To do that, use the following command :-

*git init*

6. After that, just clone the repo using the command :-

*git clone https://github.com/Prayag15-bit/ARTH-team-task-1.git*

7. After cloning gets completed, you can see that a new folder will be created with the name *ARTH-team-task-1*. Simply go inside the folder using :-

*cd ARTH-team-task-1*

8. When you finally be landed inside the folder, you will see multiple python files, but there will be a python program file with the name *main.py*. That is the main code which you have to run

# Pre-requisites to be fulfilled before running the code :-
1. Make sure that the python interpreter is already configured in your system. In case, when python interpreter is not there, just use this command to install it :-

*yum install python36*

2. Confirm the installation using the command :-

*python3 -V*

3. Now, we have to install some modules and libraries for our program. For that, there is nothing much complex to do, Just use these commands to either install the libraries or check whether they are installed :-

*pip3 install os*

*pip3 install getpass*

*pip3 install colored*

4. After successfully installing the libraries and modules, we are finally ready to run our program. Remember, this program has some authentication factors. So, while running the program, if it anywhere asks for a password, just use the password *"redhat"*

5. Execute the main program using the python interpreter as :-

*python3 main.py*

# BOOM!! The program will start executing. This is a menu driven code and the technologies me and my team integrated are listed below :-
# 1. Amazon Web Services (AWS) through CLI
# 2. Basic Linux Operations
# 3. Apache Hadoop
# 4. Docker Engine
# 5. LVM

That's it guys. I hope you will like the work of me and my team members. Honestly speaking, this program was not possible if I hadn't my team-members on my side. So, I just wanna give a huge thanks to my team members : *Mahima Jindal*, *Pawar Suvarna* and *Jitender Mahara*. In case of any difficulty, you can refer the post on my LinkedIn.
